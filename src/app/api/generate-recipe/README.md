## Speech Script for Presentation

"Ladies and gentlemen, today I'm excited to present our AI Recipe Generation System, a sophisticated culinary assistant that combines the art of cooking with the power of artificial intelligence.

Our system uses a unique template-based approach that understands the nuances of different cuisines. When you provide your available ingredients, the system doesn't just throw them together randomly. Instead, it:

1. Analyzes your ingredients and identifies the main components
2. Matches them with appropriate cooking techniques from the selected cuisine
3. Generates a recipe that's both practical and delicious

The system is particularly smart about:
- Calculating appropriate ingredient quantities
- Suggesting complementary ingredients
- Adapting to dietary preferences
- Providing detailed nutritional information

For example, if you input 'chicken, rice, and tomatoes' and select 'Italian' cuisine, the system will:
1. Create a recipe name that reflects these ingredients
2. Add typical Italian ingredients like garlic and herbs
3. Generate authentic Italian cooking instructions
4. Calculate cooking time and difficulty level
5. Provide a complete nutritional breakdown

What makes our system special is its ability to maintain culinary authenticity while being flexible enough to work with whatever ingredients you have on hand. It's like having a professional chef who understands your dietary needs and can create a delicious meal from your available ingredients.

The system is constantly learning and improving, with new cuisine templates and cooking techniques being added regularly. Whether you're a beginner cook or a seasoned chef, our AI Recipe Generator can help you create meals that are both delicious and tailored to your preferences."
